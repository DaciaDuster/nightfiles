## What is this?
Nightsky is a collection of applications, color themes, configs, etc. to make your Arch based system usable from the start, without shipping anything unnecessary, and furthermore, allowing for extensive change!

## What is it based on?
Nightsky includes various resources from other brojects, like
- [Chrome Startpage (eaaasun/startpage)](https://github.com/eaaasun/startpage)
- [Catppuccin (catppuccin org)](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)

Assume the root of the repo is your home folder.
