## What is it based on?
Nightsky includes various resources from other brojects, like
- [Chrome Startpage (eaaasun/startpage)](https://github.com/eaaasun/startpage)
- [Catppuccin (catppuccin org)](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)

## Installation and setup
Clone the repo locally.

Firstly, you should install the packages. Open a terminal of choice (Will be replaced with alacritty), and install your favorite AUR helper. Mine is `yay`, so i will go by it.

To install the packages needed for the setup, go to the directory where you cloned the repo, and do:
```
yay -S - < deplist.nightsky
```
Then follow the steps your AUR helper gives you.

**(The deplist may be incomplete! If you notice something not working, feel free to add any packages into the list, and I will see if I did, in fact, miss them.)**
