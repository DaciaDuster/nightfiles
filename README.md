## What is this?
Nightsky is a collection of applications, color themes, configs, etc. to make your Arch based system usable from the start, without shipping anything unnecessary, and furthermore, allowing for extensive change!

## What is it based on?
Nightsky includes various resources from other brojects, like
- [Chrome Startpage (eaaasun/startpage)](https://github.com/eaaasun/startpage)
- [Catppuccin (catppuccin org)](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)

## Installation
### Recommended method
Use the installation script.

(Do this preferably on a clear arch installation, after you do your first reboot into a working system)
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerichdev/nightfiles/main/skyinstall.sh
chmod +x skyinstall.sh
./skyinstall.sh
```
